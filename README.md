# About the Game
Arcade Maniac is going to be a game based in an Arcade. There are going to be 20 games, all of which a different genre. You must complete at least 12 games to partial completion (different per game) to beat it, but you get to choose which games to beat, or you can choose to beat all of the games. Each game has a partial completion split, but you can complete them to 100% if you want. This game will be free, but I will gladly accept donations!

# Itch
The itch page is being released now to the public, and can be found [here](https://that-one-nerd.itch.io/arcade-maniac). Alpha snapshots will be released when something playable is avaliable. If you find a bug, please let me know either in the comments on the Itch Page, or on my Discord. The Itch Page will also be home to the devlogs sent. Speaking of which,

# Devlogs
Devlogs are going to happen every week, though I don't know exactly when. The devlogs are going to detail every change that happened since the previous devlog. They will be sent to Itch and in my discord.

# Github
This game will come open-sourced, which means that a github is the next part of the puzzle. Whenever a devlog is released, a commit will follow there. It can be found here.

# Unity
This game will always be kept up to date on the newest Unity versions to help prevent bugs. This game will start on version `Unity 2021.1.18f1`, but will update as Unity does.

# Launcher
Yes, you heard me right, a launcher will accompany this game, and will be the actual thing you download on the itch page. This launcher will use very sophisticated coding to download files from an upload server where the games will be stored (and by that I mean I'm going to write a program to download games from Google Drive). Nothing will be downloaded originally, and will download whenever you choose a specific version. This will be another Unity project, and will also remain on the latest release of Unity. The code for this program will remain closed-source for the time being, but it may end up open source as a branch on github. I am not sure yet.

# Trello
I have a checklist currently setup on trello, and it is public for all to see. Trello is a checklist system that I use to help me stay on track. Keep in mind that this trello is not completed and can change at any time (in fact, I am currently missing 3 game genres, so it will definitely change for those). The trello is [here](https://trello.com/b/RyAX96fd/arcade-maniac).

# Donations
I will be accepting donations on my itch page for any amount. If you are willing to give some money to me, that would be great! Any amount is a great amount, even a single dollar! The only way I make money is through donations, so anything at all can help. That being said, you don't have to do any of this, and this game will still remain free throughout development.

# Multiplayer
This game will support server-based multiplayer at some point in it's development. It is not a top priority, but it's on my mind. When in multiplayer, you will skip the arcade, and just play a multiplayer mode of each minigame instead.

# Release Date
I currently have no idea what the release date is going to be, even vaguely. I used to think I could get it out by late 2022/early 2023, but I'm now thinking it might be 2023-2024, or even 2024-2025. Whatever the case, it is not coming out for at least a year. Sorry about that. However, the release date will get more fine tuned as time goes on.

That's about it! There is a lot to come in this game, so stay tuned! I'll be streaming game development occasionally on my [Youtube](https://youtube.com/channel/UCeKaBeycUz-sHna0ypFykwA) channel and my [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/that_only_nerd) channel. Have a good one!
